The model works by having a series of strings using a hash-symbol to represent where the 
tiles are

For example, when trying to construct an "L-piece", we want
the entire top row and only the first tile of the second row to be
filled in. We can do this by using the following

"###"
"#"

The reason why we don't need for the second string to be, "#  " is because it will
add that tile and then terminate without needing to go through the empty spaces.

Another example is the "T-piece". We again fill in the top row as before but for this
piece, we will want only the middle of the second piece (the second value of the second piece)
to be filled in, like so:

"###"
" #"
The reason why we don't need a space after the # in the second value is because there are no more
values to add in that row. 

For neatness sake, you could add an additional space to make it
"###"
" # "
but that would add an additional search that isn't needed
